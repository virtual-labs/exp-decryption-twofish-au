      "question": "What is the initial step in the Twofish decryption process?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Inverse F-Function",
        "b": "Key Schedule",
        "c": "Feistel Network Decryption",
        "d": "Subkey Mixing"
      },
      "explanation": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The initial step in Twofish decryption is the Key Schedule, responsible for generating round subkeys.",
        "b": "Correct. The Twofish decryption process begins with the Key Schedule, generating round subkeys from the secret key.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Feistel Network Decryption is a later stage in the Twofish decryption process.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Subkey Mixing occurs at various stages but is not the initial step in decryption."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",

      "question": "Which operation is a part of the F-function in Twofish during encryption?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Subkey Mixing",
        "b": "MDS Matrix Multiplication",
        "c": "XOR-ing with Constants",
        "d": "Feistel Network Decryption"
      },
      "explanation": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Subkey Mixing is a separate operation in Twofish and not part of the F-function.",
        "b": "Correct. The F-function in Twofish involves MDS Matrix Multiplication among other operations.",
        "c": "Incorrect. XOR-ing with Constants is not directly part of the F-function in Twofish encryption.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Feistel Network Decryption is a distinct process in Twofish."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",

    },
    {
      "question": "What does the Feistel Network structure in Twofish do during decryption?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Applies F-function to both data halves simultaneously",
        "b": "Mixes subkeys with the data",
        "c": "Splits the data into two halves",
        "d": "Reverses the order of subkeys"
      },
      "explanation": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The F-function is applied to one data half at a time in Twofish decryption.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Mixing subkeys with data is a step, but not the primary function of the Feistel Network structure.",
        "c": "Correct. The Feistel Network structure splits the data into two halves during decryption.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The order of subkeys is reversed at different stages, not directly by the Feistel Network."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
