      "question": "What is the purpose of subkey mixing in Twofish during decryption?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To generate round subkeys",
        "b": "To reverse the order of subkeys",
        "c": "To ensure accurate data reconstruction",
        "d": "To apply modular arithmetic"
      },
      "explanation": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Subkey mixing does not generate round subkeys during decryption; it involves combining subkeys with data.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Subkey mixing ensures accurate data reconstruction by applying subkeys in the correct order.",
        "c": "Correct. Subkey mixing is crucial in Twofish decryption to accurately reconstruct the original data.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Modular arithmetic is part of some operations but not the primary purpose of subkey mixing."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",

      "question": "What additional operations might be performed in the final round of Twofish decryption?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Key Schedule",
        "b": "XOR-ing with specific constants",
        "c": "Feistel Network Decryption",
        "d": "MDS Matrix Multiplication"
      },
      "explanation": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Key Schedule is not performed in the final round of Twofish decryption.",
        "b": "Correct. XOR-ing with specific constants is one of the additional operations in the final round of Twofish decryption.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Feistel Network Decryption is not typically part of the final round in Twofish decryption.",
        "d": "Incorrect. MDS Matrix Multiplication is not performed in the final round of Twofish decryption."

    {
      "question": "How does the Twofish algorithm obtain the decrypted data?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "After the Feistel Network Decryption",
        "b": "By applying the inverse F-Function",
        "c": "Through subkey mixing",
        "d": "By XOR-ing with random constants"
      },
      "explanation": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Decrypted data is obtained after completing all rounds and final operations, not specifically after Feistel Network Decryption.",
        "b": "Incorrect. While the F-Function is involved, decryption does not rely solely on the inverse F-Function.",
        "c": "Correct. The decrypted data is obtained through the application of subkey mixing and other operations.",
        "d": "Incorrect. XOR-ing with random constants is not part of the standard Twofish decryption process."
