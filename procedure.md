# Twofish Decryption Simulation Procedure

## Objective
The objective of this experiment is to simulate the Twofish decryption algorithm and provide students with a visual understanding of the internal workings of the decryption process. Participants will enter a 16-character ciphertext message, which will be internally converted to its corresponding 128-bit binary and hexa-decimal representation. The ciphertext will then undergo the standard 16-round Twofish decryption algorithm, and students will be able to view the internal workings for each round.

## Experimental Setup

### Input
1. Students input a 16-character ciphertext message.

### Conversion
2. The entered ciphertext message is internally converted to the corresponding 128-bit binary representation.
3. The binary representation is further converted to its hexa-decimal representation.

### Twofish Decryption
4. The hexa-decimal ciphertext is fed into the standard 16-round Twofish decryption algorithm.
5. Each round involves a series of predefined calculations.

### Visualization
6. Hexa-decimal data is represented as a matrix for better understanding.
7. Each step of the decryption process is clearly visualized to aid student comprehension.

### User Interaction
8. Students can click provided buttons to view the internal workings of the decryption process for each round.

### Intermediate Result
9. Participants will be asked to calculate the (k+1)th intermediate result after the first k rounds.

### Evaluation
10. If the student provides the correct answer, the remainder of the decryption simulation will be shown.

## Conclusion
This experiment aims to enhance students' understanding of the Twofish decryption algorithm by providing a hands-on, visual representation of the process. The interactive nature of the simulation encourages active participation and reinforces theoretical knowledge.
